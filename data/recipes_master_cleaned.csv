If you are using canned, look for a can that does not have any salt listed in the ingredients. Some varieties are actually cooked with kombu, which is ideal. Be sure to rinse and drain the beans before using them. Heat a large pan to medium, add olive oil and saute onion until softened. Add garlic, and saute briefly. Next, add the zucchini to the pan and saute until soft. The pepper goes in next, then the tomato very briefly. As soon as the tomato is warmed, add the spices and 1 tsp of the salt. Stir the drained peas into the vegetables, and add the other tsp of salt. Stir to combine. Spoon the mix into the middle of each tortilla, fold in both ends and roll. Place the rolls in a baking dish and put in the oven at 300 degrees F for 15-20 minute.","20","20","40"

Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, turning occasionally, at least 1 hour and up to overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill to high. Grill the tenderloin, turning occasionally, until just cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Transfer tenderloin to a plate and set aside to cool to room temperature before proceeding. Once cooled, slice tenderloin into 1/8-inch thick slices and set aside, covered and refrigerated, until you are ready to assemble the spring rolls. Prepare the rice vermicelli according to package directions and strain in a colander. Run under cold running water until cool and set aside to drain. Assemble the rolls 1 at a time: Dip 1 spring roll wrapper into lukewarm water and quickly transfer to a clean kitchen towel. (Wrapper will soften within seconds. Lay 4 shrimp halves in a horizontal line across the center of each wrapper and top with a few tablespoons of cooked (well-drained vermicelli. Top the vermicelli with 1 or 2 slices of cucumber, 2 tablespoons or so of the shredded romaine, 4 mint leaves, 2 sprigs of cilantro, and 4 basil leaves. Place a few sticks of carrot julienne along the top of the filling ingredients and top with 2 slices of pork. Carefully pull the lower edge of the wrapper up and over the filling. Fold the 2 sides inward over the filling and press to seal. Work carefully so as not to tear the wrapper. Once both sides are folded inward over the filling, roll the spring roll upwards so that the filling is tightly contained and roll up to seal. Set the spring roll aside on a plate, covered with a damp paper towel or damp clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Once you have assembled all of the spring rolls, serve them immediately – either at room temperature or slightly chilled, with the Peanut Sauce on the side for dipping. Directions for Peanut Sauce: Heat the oil in a small saucepan and, when hot, add the garlic, chile paste, and tomato paste, and cook until garlic is golden, about 30 seconds. Add the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly before serving. Serve in small bowls, garnished with the peanuts, sliced chiles and optional hot sauce. May be served warm or at room temperature. Yield: about 1 1/4 cups.","30","60","90"

When you reach the core, slice the sides of the cauliflower in the same manner. Chop any large florets into smaller bits (about 1-2 inch pieces. Discard the core. Drizzle olive oil over a large baking sheet. Add all the cauliflower to the baking sheet, drizzle with a bit more olive oil and roll around so that cauliflower is coated. Season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast cauliflower for 16-35 minutes, until browned in spots and large pieces of cauliflower are tender when poked with a knife. Meanwhile, while cauliflower is roasting, place raisins in a bowl and pour boiling water over the cover. Let sit to plump. Toast almonds in a skillet until lightly browned and fragrant. Transfer cauliflower to a serving bowl. Drain raisins, and add raisins and almonds to cauliflower, stirring to mix.

Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C. Prepare a 9 inch springform pan with a circle of parchment paper in the bottom and grease the sides. 2. To make the cake batter, beat the sugar and butter together until light in color and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Don’t skimp on the creaming. 3. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract and mix until well incorporated. 4. Add the egg whites and mix until well combined. 5. Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl, then add half of the dry ingredients to batter and mix until well incorporated. 6. Add the milk and water and mix until well incorporated. 7. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until well incorporated and smooth. 8. Stir in the sprinkles and color the batter, if desired. 9. Spread the cake batter evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. 10. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs. Set the cake aside to cool. TO MAKE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING:, 11. Add the cream cheese, sugar and flour to a large mixer bowl and beat on low speed until completely combined and smooth. Be sure to use low speed to reduce the amount of air added to the batter, which can cause cracks. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. 12. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract mix on low speed until well combined. 13. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly to combine after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well combined. 14. Stir in the sprinkles. 15. When the cake layer has cooled, reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (148°C. Remove the sides of the springform pan and clean it off, the respray it with non-stick spray. You want to be sure it’s well done so that they cheesecake doesn’t stick to the sides after baking. 16. Reset the springform pan edges around the cake and add the cream cheese filling to the pan. 17. Prepare the pan for a water bath by wrapping the outside of the pan with aluminum foil, then place the springform pan inside another larger pan. Fill the outside pan with enough warm water to go about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. The water should not go above the top edge of the aluminum foil on the springform pan. 18. Bake for 1 hour. The center should be set, but still jiggly. 19. Turn off the oven and leave the door closed for 30 minutes. The cheesecake will continue to cook, but slowly begin to cool as well. 20. Crack the door of the oven for 30 minutes to allow the cheesecake to continue to cool slowly. This process helps prevent cracking. 21. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and water bath wrapping and refrigerate until firm, 5-6 hours or overnight. Once completely cool and firm, remove from the springform pan. TO FINISH OFF THE CHEESECAKE. 22. Add the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar and vanilla extract to a large mixer bowl and whip on high speed until stiff peaks form. 23. Add the icing color to get the shade of pink you want. 24. Pipe the whipped cream on top of the cheesecake. I used a large round tip, Ateco 808. 25. Add a few more sprinkles on top of the cheesecake, then refrigerate until ready to serve. Cheesecake is best for 3-4 days.","60","30","90"

Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.
