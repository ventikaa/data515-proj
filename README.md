Tool Project (with analytical and data presentation components)

Questions of Interest
- How can recipe selection and grocery planning tools reduce barriers to cooking at home for individuals?

The project introduces a recipe-driven grocery planning tool designed to reduce everyday barriers to cooking at home. Users can select a recipe from a recipe database, and the system automatically generates a store-specific grocery list with real-time pricing and availability using the Kroger Development API. This tool is intended to support more affordable and efficient home cooking, especially for users in or near food desert regions where cost, time, and access are major constraints.

By integrating spatial food access data with individual-level decision tools, this project demonstrates how data systems can move beyond analysis into actionable interventions. The final system includes a data pipeline, interactive map visualizations, and a backend data tool that together highlight inequities in food access while offering a concrete mechanism to help mitigate their impact.

Key Components
- Recipe dataset ingestion and normalization
- Grocery pricing and availability integration via Kroger API
- End-to-end data pipelines supporting both analytics and user tools
