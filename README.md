Tool Project (with analytical and data presentation components)

Questions of Interest
- Where are food deserts located across the United States, and how do they intersect with income, geographic access to supermarkets, and fast food density?
- How have patterns of food access and food insecurity changed over time at the census tract level?
- How can data systems move beyond identifying food access inequities to supporting individual-level action?
- How can recipe selection and grocery planning tools reduce barriers to cooking at home for individuals living in or near food deserts?
- This project combines food access analytics with a practical cooking and grocery planning tool to address food insecurity from both a structural and individual perspective.

On a macro level, the project analyzes food deserts across the United States, visualizing the intersection of income, geographic access to supermarkets, and fast food density. Using public datasets from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, Census Bureau ACS 5-Year Estimates, and local health datasets, we identify and map high-risk food desert areas and examine how these patterns have evolved over time.

On a micro level, the project introduces a recipe-driven grocery planning tool designed to reduce everyday barriers to cooking at home. Users can select a recipe from a recipe database, and the system automatically generates a store-specific grocery list with real-time pricing and availability using the Kroger Development API. This tool is intended to support more affordable and efficient home cooking, especially for users in or near food desert regions where cost, time, and access are major constraints.

By integrating spatial food access data with individual-level decision tools, this project demonstrates how data systems can move beyond analysis into actionable interventions. The final system includes a data pipeline, interactive map visualizations, and a backend data tool that together highlight inequities in food access while offering a concrete mechanism to help mitigate their impact.
